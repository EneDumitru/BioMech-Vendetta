---How to swap to URP or HDRP Render Pipelines---

1.) Install your Render Pipeline if you have not already.

2.) Switch to your Render Pipeline in the Project Settings.
2.a) If using Basic, ensure that your color space is Linear
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LinearRendering-LinearOrGammaWorkflow.html

3.) Inside the "AlienPlantsVol3" folder, I want you to delete all folders except for the "Textures" folder
So delete these folders:
- Materials
- Meshes
- Prefabs
- Scenes
- Scripts
- Shaders
- Sound

4.) If you want to use BasicRP, also ensure that the "StreamingAssets folder" has these contents deleted:
- FoliageData_AlienPlants_Vol3_A_Level
- FoliageData_Demonstration_B

5.) Inside the "AlienPlantsVol3" folder, you'll find two packages.
Extract your chosen Render Pipeline Package
(Choose from the following)
- BasicRP_Patch
- URP_Patch

6.) Now you can open your levels! Locate them in:
Assets/Davis3D/AlienPlantsVol3/Scenes

If you encounter any errors, please check the following:

1.) There should be a folder called "StreamingAssets" inside your Unity project's "Assets" folder.
If you cannot see one there, please go to the following web address and download it:

2.) If you encounter shader errors, please contact me at 
justin@davis3d.com

Most of the time, when new engine versions come out, Amplify Shader editor will need to be redownloaded, reinstalled, and all the shaders recompiled.
I will do my best to keep track of this, but sometimes i may miss an update.
I will also provide these shaders in this location while Unity Administrators take time to update the asset on the product page:
